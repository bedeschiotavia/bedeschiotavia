# Hey there!!

I'm Otávia Bedeschi, a front-end developer making the leap from a background in graphic design and web design, racking up over 5 years of professional experience in the design world. Originally from Brazil and currently living in Portugal.

Right now, I'm diving headfirst into JavaScript and React, sharpening my skills to rock it in front-end development. With my design background, I'm all about crafting cool and user-friendly web experiences.

Back in Brazil, before diving into design and development, I was doing my thing in the EHS (Environment, Health, and Safety) field, where I got the scoop on environmental stuff, risk management, and following the rules (compliance and ISO audits).

With a solid mix of design and development chops, I'm pumped to team up on projects that need a splash of creativity, innovation, and smooth user vibes. 
Let's bring some ideas to life together!
